COMAL 80 for C128

In December of 2020 I was asked by KEN SIMMONS to create a comal-80 cartridge, for the Commodore 64, from an old COMAL TODAY magazine schematic. The COMAL80 cartridge uses unique 'bankswithcing' to switch up to 96KB of ROM.

This project is a result of that task. 

The board is a simple 2 layer design, with (3) 27C256 EPROMS, and (4) logic devices (74LS00, 74LS125N, 74LS161, 74LS139), others may be substitued but are not known at this time.

1-21-2021 Deemed C128 schematic un-useable, it is not correct. Various errors. Do not use!

1-19-2021 C64/C128 folders added. C128 Comal Cartridge schematic added. Updated readme.md for each. Added C128 ROM files (U1, U2, U3)

1-18-2021	GutHub creation and release of V1. Design is known working and completed. No known issues or releases planned.
